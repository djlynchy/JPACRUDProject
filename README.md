## Lessons learned
one of the things i learned is its rather difficult to manage backshop, frontshop, and time management.

i got a better understanding of how each part plays with each other.

i learned why typos are the bane of programers everywhere.

i also think my idea bit off more than i could chew with time constraints.

## Future Goals
i think this program has alot of potential, i know everyone says that about their own projects. a few things id like to add is a search by caliber, maker, action and type, afterall, there is a plethora  of firearms out there in the world.

further idea was to include your own firearms, list serial numbers for identification if lost or stolen. as well as pictures and descriptions of the firearms entered in.
